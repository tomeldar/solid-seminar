/**
 * While we won't use this file, it's here to illustrate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
 * A use case should focus on a single action or responsibility.
 * In a real-world scenario, services can grow large and unwieldy.
 * By breaking them down into focused use cases, we enhance maintainability and clarity.
 *
 * In this example, the UserRoleManagementUseCase is solely responsible for managing user roles.
 * It encapsulates all logic related to adding or removing roles from users.
 * This keeps the UserService cleaner and more focused on user-related operations.
